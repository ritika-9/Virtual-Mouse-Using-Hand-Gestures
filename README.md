This is a basic virtual mouse using hand gestures.
You can move the cursor using your index finger, while thumb is closed.
Once the thumb is open, the cursor stops.
You can do a left click, by bending the index finger while the thumb is open.
You can do a right click, by bending the middle finger while the thumb is open.
You can do a double click by bending both the index and middle finger.
You can take a screenshot by bending all the fingers(making a fist position).
This project was made on Jupyter.
